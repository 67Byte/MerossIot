We (developers) all know how important is to get things working fast.

.. note::
   Immediately getting hands dirty with code is OK for quick demos.
   However, you should really read the entire documentation carefully in order to avoid
   gotchas. After all, someone has taken the effort of writing some documentation, why
   would you not read it?
